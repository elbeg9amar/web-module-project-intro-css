      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best 
      known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles
      , you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, 
      a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire 
      carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems.
       This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for 
       current fire restrictions.</p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, c
      amping, and backpacking. You can pay the park entrance fee upon 
      arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
